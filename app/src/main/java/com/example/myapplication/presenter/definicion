--The Presentation Layer--

-This includes our Activities,
-Fragments,
-and ViewModels.

An Activity should be as dumb as possible. Never put your business logic in Activities.

-Contains UI,
-View Objects,
-Android components, etc.

Can be split into separate modules itself if needed. For example, we could have a module called Device handling things like camera, location, etc.
